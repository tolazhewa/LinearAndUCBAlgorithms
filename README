This repository contains three reinforcement algorithms:

- UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) contained in q1.cpp
- L(r-p) (Linear Reward-Penaty) contained in q2.cpp
- L(r-i) (Linear Reward-Inaction) contained in q2.cpp

There are parameters to adjust for all the algorithms. 
Open q1.cpp and there is a settable configuration section for UCB.
Open q2.cpp and there is a settable configuration section for L(r-i) and L(r-p) are bound to the same program.

There is a lot of flexibility so feel free to experiment with it as you like :)

To run q1 please execute the following commands:
> make q1
> ./q1.o

To run q2 please execute the following commands:
> make q2
> ./q2.o

Two files for each execution will be produced:
- ".out" file (e.g q1.out): A dump file that will print out the progression of the algorithm
- "_stats" file (e.g q1_stats): A stats file produced at the end to analyze parameters

Enjoy!
